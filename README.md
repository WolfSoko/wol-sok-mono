# SuperheroicCoding: Some examples with Angular+, Angular-Material, p5, three.js,  

Just some cool examples implemented in angular for topics that interesting for me. 

The topics are science algorithms like poisson distribution and reaction diffusion.
Also shader programming with webgl and AI are given. 
Firebase is used for persistence of custom webgl shaders.  
For visualization p5 and three.js are used.

I always try to keep a good code structure as defined in the Angular style guide and NX monorepo structure.
Also I love rxjs and use it as much as I can.
For components, I use Angular-Material.    
CSS wise I use grid and flex layout.

This project was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev/l/a/getting-started/intro) 

To deploy it I use github actions and AWS S3, with Cloudfront

## sc-thanos
A special angular-component is extracted from these experiments called `sc-thanos`. 
It vaporizes your html Elements into tiny atoms. 
[sc-thanos on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sc-thanos)

Readme under: [Sc-Thanos README.md](./libs/sc-thanos/README.md)

A running version can be found on github pages: https://angularexamples.superheroiccoding.de/
