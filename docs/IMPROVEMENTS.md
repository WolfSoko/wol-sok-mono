This document provides a prioritized list of documentation issues identified across the wol-sok-mono repository, along with recommended fixes.

## Priority Levels

- **Critical**: Issues that significantly impact developer onboarding or project understanding
- **High**: Important missing documentation or significant inconsistencies
- **Medium**: Quality improvements and minor inconsistencies
- **Low**: Nice-to-have improvements and polish

---

## Critical Priority Issues

### 1. Missing Project Overview Documentation

**Issue**: No high-level architecture or project structure documentation exists in the docs folder.

**Impact**: New developers cannot understand the monorepo structure, application purposes, or how components relate to each other.

**Fix**: Create `ARCHITECTURE.md` with:
- Monorepo structure overview
- Description of each application and its purpose
- Library organization and dependency relationships
- Technology stack summary
- Development workflow

**Status**: ❌ Not Fixed

---

### 2. Incomplete Getting Started Guide

**Issue**: README.md provides minimal setup instructions; lacks troubleshooting, prerequisites, and complete workflow.

**Impact**: Developers may struggle with initial setup, especially regarding `node-gyp` dependencies.

**Fix**: Create `GETTING_STARTED.md` with:
- Complete prerequisites (Node.js version, system dependencies)
- Detailed installation steps
- Common setup issues and solutions
- First-time contributor workflow
- IDE setup recommendations

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Created `GETTING_STARTED.md` with comprehensive setup guide

---

### 3. Missing Testing Documentation

**Issue**: No centralized testing documentation explaining testing strategy, how to run tests, or best practices.

**Impact**: Developers don't know testing conventions or how to write proper tests for different project types.

**Fix**: Create `TESTING.md` with:
- Testing philosophy and strategy
- Unit testing guidelines (Jest)
- E2E testing guidelines (Playwright)
- How to run tests for specific projects
- Mocking strategies
- Test coverage expectations

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Created `TESTING.md` with comprehensive testing guide

---

## High Priority Issues

### 4. Inconsistent Library README Files

**Issue**: Most library READMEs are auto-generated boilerplate from Nx with minimal information (e.g., "This library was generated with Nx").

**Impact**: Developers cannot understand library purposes, APIs, or usage patterns without reading source code.

**Fix**: Update all library READMEs to include:
- Purpose and use case
- Public API overview
- Usage examples
- Dependencies
- When to use this library vs alternatives

**Affected Libraries**:
- `libs/utils/decorators`
- `libs/utils/operators`
- `libs/utils/math`
- `libs/utils/gpu-calc`
- `libs/utils/measure-fps`
- `libs/shared/ws-gl`
- `libs/shared/headline-animation`
- `libs/features/lazy/neural-networks`
- `libs/features/lazy/poisson`
- `libs/features/lazy/wasm-test`
- And others

**Status**: ❌ Not Fixed

---

### 5. Missing Application Documentation

**Issue**: No README files exist for applications, explaining their purpose, features, or how to run them.

**Impact**: Users and developers don't know what each application does or how to work with it.

**Fix**: Create README.md for each app:
- `apps/pacetrainer/README.md`
- `apps/rollapolla-analog/README.md`
- `apps/angular-examples/README.md`
- `apps/fourier-analysis-remote/README.md`
- `apps/bacteria-game-remote/README.md`
- `apps/shader-examples-remote/README.md`

Each should include:
- Application purpose and features
- How to run locally
- How to build for production
- Deployment instructions
- Key technologies used

**Status**: ❌ Not Fixed

---

### 6. Missing Deployment Documentation

**Issue**: No comprehensive deployment guide exists. Firebase and AWS CDK deployment processes are not documented.

**Impact**: Maintainers and contributors cannot reliably deploy applications.

**Fix**: Create `DEPLOYMENT.md` with:
- Firebase deployment process for each app
- AWS CDK deployment process
- Environment configuration
- Secrets management
- CI/CD pipeline explanation
- Rollback procedures

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Created `DEPLOYMENT.md` with comprehensive deployment guide

---

### 7. Incomplete AGENTS.md

**Issue**: AGENTS.md is focused on AI agent guidelines but lacks clarity on some conventions and is not comprehensive.

**Impact**: AI agents and developers may not follow consistent patterns.

**Fix**: Enhance AGENTS.md with:
- More explicit file organization rules
- Clearer examples of common tasks
- Project-specific patterns per application
- Reference to other documentation files

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Enhanced `AGENTS.md` context in README.md

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### 8. Missing Contributing Guide

**Issue**: No CONTRIBUTING.md file exists to guide contributors through the contribution process.

**Impact**: Contributors don't know how to properly submit changes, what the review process is, or coding standards.

**Fix**: Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with:
- How to set up development environment
- Code style and conventions
- Commit message format (conventional commits)
- Pull request process
- Code review expectations
- Testing requirements

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` with comprehensive contribution guide

---

### 9. ANGULAR.md Inconsistencies

**Issue**: Several inconsistencies in `docs/ANGULAR.md`:
- Line 46: Incorrect import path `'angular/core'` should be `'@angular/core'`
- Line 206: Constructor syntax `constructor(): void` is unusual (constructors don't have return types in TS)
- Mix of code examples not all relevant to this specific repository
- Some examples are generic Angular docs, not specific to this monorepo

**Impact**: Developers may copy incorrect code examples or be confused about what applies to this project.

**Fix**: 
- Correct import statement on line 46
- Fix constructor syntax on line 206
- Add a section clearly distinguishing generic Angular patterns from monorepo-specific usage
- Add references to actual code in the repository

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Corrected import path (line 46) and constructor syntax (line 206)

---

### 10. Missing API Documentation

**Issue**: No API documentation for backend services or public libraries.

**Impact**: Developers cannot understand API contracts or how to integrate with services.

**Fix**: 
- Create API documentation for tRPC endpoints
- Document Firebase Functions
- Create API reference for published libraries (like @wolsok/thanos)

**Status**: ❌ Not Fixed

---

### 11. No Migration Guides

**Issue**: Except for ws-thanos, no migration guides exist for upgrading dependencies or making breaking changes.

**Impact**: Developers struggle when major version updates occur.

**Fix**: Create `MIGRATIONS.md` with:
- Angular version upgrade procedures
- Nx migration strategies
- Breaking changes documentation
- Deprecated feature migration paths

**Status**: ❌ Not Fixed

**Impact**: Poor first impression, unclear project purpose.

**Fix**:
- Fix typo: "maintaied" → "maintained"
- Enhance project description with clear value proposition
- Add "Documentation" section with links to all docs
- Add clearer structure with sections

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Fixed typo, enhanced description, added documentation section with links

---

### 13. Missing Troubleshooting Guide

**Impact**: Developers waste time on known issues.

**Fix**: Create `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with:
- Common build errors and solutions
- Node.js/npm issues (especially node-gyp)
- Port conflicts
- Memory issues
- Platform-specific problems
- Firebase/AWS deployment issues

**Status**: ❌ Not Fixed
